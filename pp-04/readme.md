# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html#
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The current IIT login page has all the text on the same font style. All of the information seems almost the same which makes the user distracted. The user does not know where to focus on the screen. That is why there should be different and more eye catching text styles for the main portions

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-system
* How you implemented it in your sketch: As I said in the previous explanation, there is no focus on the website which is also paertly because there is no color scheme. All of the website has black text and red links with white background. This makes the website look dry.  That is why I added different
colors in the different sections. The color for the section background is the same for the login button which will make those things stand out.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/confirmation-acknowledgement.html#confirmation-acknowledgement-confirmation
* How you implemented it in your sketch: This link is for conformations but I think this could also work for the login portion of the page. On the current website the login section is on one side and does not have much emphasis, which is why I added the button for login which gives a form pop up like
a conformation on the website and blurs, not hide, the other sections of the website. This would be good for the login since when someone is trying to login they are not really focused on the other things on the page.

Other Changes: I think it would really help if there are small sections containing all the information on the current page. For example the IIT alert can have its own section, the google info can have its own section, and so on. All these sections can be linked at the top/ or not.
