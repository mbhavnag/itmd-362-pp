# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

2. https://identifywebdesign.co.uk/blog/25-key-website-usability-tips-help-conversion-ultimate-ux-checklist/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Have a design that inspires confidence, so users can be confident about using the site without being deceived.
2. Showing some way of having the users protected.
3. Buttons that do important functions should be placed on the axis of interaction.
4. The title of the site links to the Home page.
5. Add tips for forms so ambiguous or complicated questions are easier to answer.
6. Make the purpose of the website obvious.
7. Fast loading website so users don't leave the page.
8. Ads and pop ups will annoy your users.
9. Make sure the first thing that loads on the webpage is the most important information on the page.
10. Colors should be complimenting each other so users don't get disengaged.
