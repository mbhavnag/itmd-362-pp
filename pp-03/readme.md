## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13i0u0kQxmQGvAUMgrFTVhPXfbG
Your Rationale: I picked a color between green and blue because they are both associated with technology.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52m0u0kxzkHDL24F+atA4uPtnPU
Your Rationale: I picked the green and yellow shades to represent spring and also botanical Gardens.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33G0x0kGNUdRslQTewHqeTtgwTo
Your Rationale: I picked brighter colors for this because kids are more attracted to vivid and bright colors.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=b2O423D0ksHqZRl8yCUl7o+yT9oth
